Here's a sample README file for your Personal To-Do List Application. This file explains the application's purpose, features, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.


Personal To-Do List Application

 Overview

The Personal To-Do List Application is a simple yet effective task management tool built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks, making it easier to keep track of personal tasks and priorities. The application stores tasks in a local JSON file, ensuring that user progress is preserved between sessions.

 Features

- **Task Management**: 
  - Add tasks with a title, description, and category.
  - Mark tasks as completed.
  - Delete tasks from the list.
  
- **Categorization**: 
  - Assign categories (e.g., Work, Personal, Urgent) to tasks for better organization.

- **Persistence**: 
  - Automatically saves tasks to a local JSON file (`tasks.json`), allowing for data retention across application sessions.

- **User Interface**: 
  - User-friendly interface with clear prompts.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of running Python scripts.
